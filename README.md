Hi, welcome to my SQL repository! 
Here, I'll share the code for some projects that I've created using SQL. I'll be demonstrating:
#How I create tables in a database
#How I query data, inlcuding SQL Clauses, Joins and Aggregations
#How I ALTER or UPDATE data and datatypes when needed
I will start off with basic queries and I hope to get more advanced in my projects as I develop my skills :)
